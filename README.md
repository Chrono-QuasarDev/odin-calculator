# 🧮 Odin Calculator Project

A simple yet elegant calculator built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) Foundations Course.  
This project helped reinforce **JavaScript fundamentals** — DOM manipulation, event handling, and logical structuring.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Perform basic arithmetic operations — **add**, **subtract**, **multiply**, and **divide**  
✅ Supports **keyboard input** (numbers, operators, Enter, Backspace, and Clear)  
✅ Sleek, minimal **modern UI** with button hover effects  
✅ Functional **Clear button** to reset calculations  


## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project was designed to reinforce:
- DOM manipulation with `querySelector()` and event listeners
- Logical structuring using variables and functions
- Control flow with `if` statements
- Handling user input through both **click** and **keyboard** events
- Managing application state (storing and resetting numbers, operators, etc.)


## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this, I learned:
- How to break large problems into smaller, manageable **phases**
- The importance of **clear variable naming** (`firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, `currentInput`)
- How to use **event listeners** for multiple buttons efficiently with `forEach()`
- How to implement **keyboard support** that mirrors on-screen button behavior
- How to give apps personality with **fun error messages** and polish


## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|:--|:--|
| 0–9 | Input numbers |
| + - * / | Choose operator |
| Enter | Calculate result |
| Backspace | Delete last digit |
| C or Escape | Clear all |


## 🧰 Built With

- **HTML5** — for structure  
- **CSS3** — for styling and layout  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** — for interactivity and logic  


## 🧾 Development Phases (Milestones)

| Phase | Description | Git Commit Example |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Phase 1 | Set up basic HTML/CSS layout | `Initial setup: calculator structure and layout` |
| Phase 2 | Handle number input and display updates | `Added input display logic` |
| Phase 3 | Add operator and equals logic using `operate()` | `Implemented operate() function` |
| Phase 4 | Add funny and error messages | `Added humorous divide-by-zero and invalid operator handling` |
| Phase 5 | Implement Clear button | `Added Clear button functionality` |
| Phase 6 | Add keyboard support | `✨ Added full keyboard support for calculator` |


## 🧠 Future Improvements
- Add **decimal support** with precision handling  
- Add **keyboard-only backspace functionality** (already planned!)  
- Animate button presses for better UX  
- Add sound effects or haptic feedback  


## 🏁 Final Thoughts

“They said: build a simple calculator.
I said: how hard can it be?

Three emotional breakdowns, 47 console.logs, and one minor existential crisis later...
I have achieved basic math functionality. 🎉

Press clear to start over. Just like my life.” 😭
